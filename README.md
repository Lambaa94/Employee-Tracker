## Description

This was my first project that I got to work with *MYSQL*. At first this seemed like a very easy task to accomplish but as I worked on I noticed that it is a very involved task to accomplish. Coming across many barriers and failed attempts I did get the application to be fully functioning. Starting with laying out my schema for *MYSQL* and a seeds file to populate my table I was able to map out what I had to accomplish. I learned that are many different ways to display information using a database but there are many ways that items can be incorrectly used and reused. *MYSQL* is going to be something that I would like to invest a lot of my time learning as I can tell how this will be used greatly in this field. With many buisnesses needing databases to work with to keep everything organized, this will become a much needed skill.
